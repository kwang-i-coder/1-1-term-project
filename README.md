# 🚇 Seoul Metro Line 2 Passenger Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes the boarding and alighting patterns of Seoul Metro Line 2 for the year 2022.  
By identifying high-traffic stations and time slots, the project aims to understand passenger flow, commuting behavior, and derive insights that could inform urban planning and commercial area development.

## 🎯 Motivation

During my time living in Seoul, I noticed that subway usage is heavily concentrated around business, school, and commercial districts.  
Instead of occasional leisure travel, most passengers seem to use the subway for commuting purposes.  
This observation led me to explore **whether key areas like Gangnam, Hongdae, Shinchon, and Konkuk University** stations truly exhibit higher ridership due to the presence of companies, universities, and shopping districts.

## 🔍 Hypothesis

> "Passenger traffic on Line 2 is significantly higher at stations near major business districts and university zones, especially during commuting hours (7–9 AM, 6–8 PM)."
